# Undergraduate Thesis Paper @Syracuse University

Economic theory suggests that an increase in the supply of labor will reduce the wage for
all workers (native and immigrant). This paper uses aggregate data to examine the effect
of increasing share of immigrant worker on relative wage level. Pooling the Scientists
and Engineers Statistical Data System Surveys in 2003, 2006 and 2008, the OLS result
suggests that increasing share of immigrant worker has a negative effect on wage for all
workers. The estimates suggest that an additional percent increase in immigrant share
within the occupation will lower the annual median salary by $220.50 if other things
being equal. And the higher degrees the workers receive, the lower the immigration will
affect their wage. However, the estimates are not statistically different from zero.
